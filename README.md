## Installation

To use this script, you need a userscript manager browser extension. [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is recommended.

1.  **Install a Userscript Manager**:
    -   [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
    -   [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
    -   [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepofnechongfnn)

2.  **Install the Userscript**:
    -   Open the `LinkedIn-Sales-Navigator-Scraper.user.js` file.
    -   Your userscript manager should automatically detect it and prompt you to install it.
    -   Click **Install**.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to a LinkedIn Sales Navigator people search results page.
    -   Example URL: `https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people...`
2.  The **SN Scraper** UI will appear in the top-right corner of the page.
3.  Click the **Start Scraping** button to begin the process. The script will start on the current page and automatically navigate through all subsequent pages.
4.  You can monitor the progress in the UI, which shows the current page and the total number of profiles collected.
5.  Once the scrape is complete, the **Export MD** button will be enabled. Click it to download the Markdown file with all the collected data.

## Configuration

The script includes a `CONFIG` object at the top of the file that allows you to customize its behavior:

-   `DELAY_BETWEEN_PAGES`: Time (in ms) to wait after scraping a page before navigating to the next one.
-   `MAX_RETRIES`: Number of times to retry a failed operation.
-   `BATCH_SIZE`: The expected number of results per page (typically 25).
-   `SCROLL_STEP_PX`: The distance (in pixels) to scroll in each step to trigger lazy-loading.
-   `SCROLL_PAUSE_MS`: The pause (in ms) between each scroll step.
-   `LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`: The maximum time (in ms) to wait for all profiles on a single page to load.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Scraper UI not appearing**:
   - Ensure Tampermonkey is enabled

   - Refresh the page

2. **No profiles detected**:
   - Wait for search results to fully load
   - Check that results are visible on the page
   - Try refreshing and waiting longer

3. **Export button disabled**:
   - Ensure profiles have been scraped first
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Navigation issues**:
   - Verify you have access to multiple pages
   - Check your Sales Navigator subscription status
